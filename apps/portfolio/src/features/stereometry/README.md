# Stereometry

A 3D construction workbench for stereometry puzzles with per-fragment occlusion of construction lines.

Live: [https://frozik.github.io/portfolio/stereometry](https://frozik.github.io/portfolio/stereometry) · Part of the [portfolio](../../../../../README.md) monorepo; code lives in `apps/portfolio/src/features/stereometry/`.

Interactive 3D construction tool for stereometry puzzles — a digital
geometry workbench rendered with WebGPU. Pick a figure, draw
construction lines, find intersection points, and explore cross-sections
of solids.

**Construction:**
- Drag from one vertex to another to draw a construction line; the
  target vertex highlights when your line snaps to it
- Double-click any edge to extend it into an infinite construction
  line that cuts across the figure
- Drag a line onto a vertex to drop a parallel line through that
  point; a quick tap selects the line, and a tap on a vertex then drops
  the parallel too
- Double-click a line to delete it; duplicate lines are ignored
  automatically
- Intersection points appear wherever two lines cross and become
  first-class snap targets for new lines
- Full undo / redo history

**Visuals:**
- Parts of a line occluded by the solid render dashed; visible
  stretches stay solid — decided per-fragment, so the effect stays
  correct from every camera angle
- Vertex markers render as filled or stroked circles and are
  occlusion-tested against both the figure's faces and any lines
  passing through them
- Elements farther from the camera fade smoothly toward transparency,
  giving a sense of depth without needing a grid
- Selection, hover, and "inside the figure" states flow through a
  CSS-like style cascade — adding a new state (e.g. `marked`) is a
  one-line change
- Orthographic or perspective projection with 4× MSAA anti-aliasing

**Interactions:**
- Drag to rotate the camera, Shift+drag to pan, scroll or pinch to
  zoom — with inertia on all three
- Unified pointer handling works identically on mouse, touch, and
  stylus; no duplicate events on mobile

**Puzzle format:**
- Declarative puzzle files: list of figures (vertices + faces), input
  constraints (points, lines), expected result
- Edges and face adjacency derive automatically from the face list —
  puzzle authors only describe what's unique to the puzzle
